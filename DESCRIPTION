Description: Drop-in replacements for the base system2() function with fine control
    and consistent behavior across platforms. Supports clean interruption, timeout, 
    background tasks, and streaming STDIN / STDOUT / STDERR over binary or text 
    connections. Arguments on Windows automatically get encoded and quoted to work 
    on different locales.
