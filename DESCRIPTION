Description: Powerful replacements for base system2 with consistent behavior
    across platforms. Supports interruption, background tasks, and full control over
    STDOUT / STDERR binary or text streams. On Unix systems the package also has
    functions for evaluating expressions inside a temporary fork. Such evaluations
    have no side effects on the main R process, and support reliable interrupts and
    timeouts. This provides the basis for a sandboxing mechanism.
