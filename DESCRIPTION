Description: Powerful and reliable drop-in replacements for base system / system2 
    functions with consistent behavior across platforms. Supports interruption, 
    timeouts, background tasks, and full control over STDIN / STDOUT / STDERR 
    binary or text streams. On Windows, arguments get properly encoded and quoted
    to work on different locales. On Unix systems the package also has functions for 
    evaluating expressions inside a temporary fork. Such evaluations have no side 
    effects on the main R process, and support reliable interrupts and timeouts. 
    This provides the basis for a sandboxing mechanism.
